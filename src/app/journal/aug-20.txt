I guess I can keep a chess journal here.
Doesn't really belong in the DEV journal.

Basically I went to the KW chess club for the first time today.
I'll sign up for CFC and get a rating, that'll be cool.

Excited! Blitz today, went 4.5/5. Only unrated opponents except the draw, he was 1050 ish i think?
